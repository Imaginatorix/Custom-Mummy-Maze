# Custom-Mummy-Maze
A Mummy Maze Imitation (Practice Project)

Unadded Features of the Original Mummy Maze:
- Gate + Key
- The built-in levels
  
Features added not from that of the Original Mummy Maze:
- Custom Maze Making - in game_attr.py
- Solver [Unpolished] - implemented using a recursive function
<br>                    (occasionally makes useless moves, like, although not always useless (in the case of manipulating the mummy), [left, left, right, right])
  
Plan to add:
- A sort of other gamemode which makes Maze Making easier
