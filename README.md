# Custom-Mummy-Maze
A Mummy Maze Imitation (Practice Project)

Why Minimax instead of BFS? Well, I wanted to try and add sentient enemies, which try to avoid getting killed by other monsters and try to eat the player. I kinda stopped actively coding this program as there is no point to continue it. I already know how to implement both DFS and Minimax to an acceptable degree, via Project0 in CS50ai.

I might continue this in the future, but now that I am still trying to invest more time in trying to familiarize much complex forms of AI, I'm temporarily going to put this one on the closet.
